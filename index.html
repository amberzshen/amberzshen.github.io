Hi! I am a currently a PhD student in the Harvard Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics program and a member of Debbie Marks' Lab. I am interested in autoimmunity and human genetics. Before graduate school, I studied math and MIT and worked on using single-cell RNA-seq data to study HLA expression and post-transcriptional regulation.
